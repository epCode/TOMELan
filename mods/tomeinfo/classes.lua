tomeinfo.classes.warrior = {
  cc =
  [[Warriors solve most problems by cutting them to pieces. They are good at fighting and bows/throws but bad at most other things, although they can train to use magic devices. They are able to dual- wield one-handers, which requires light armour. they may choose the path of a martial artist, foregoing weapons for fighting bare-handed instead. In most cases warrior are seen using two-handers, or one-hander and shield, and heavy armour to go with either.]]
}

tomeinfo.classes.archer = {
  cc =
  [[Archers are to ranged combats what warriors are to melee brawls. No class deals more damage in ranged fights than an archer who is equipped in ultimate gear. Having said that, few classes are as dependant on their weapon to deal damage as the archer is. They are bad at close quarters, and may get hindered when trying to shoot, but can train calmness to overcome this. One of the techniques they learn is to craft ammunition from rubble (slings) and bones (bows/crossbows). Dexterity is their primary stat, and the lighter armour they wear, the better is their aim.]]
}

tomeinfo.classes.ranger = {
  cc =
  [[Rangers are very versatile, able to fight in close combat, or use ranged weapons. Their intelligence is prime for ability to use complicated devices. They are able to train Archery up to 10, allowing them to acquire all ranged techniques. They are even able to dual-wield two one-handed weapons, same as warriors and rogues may do. Devoted to nature they avoid evil fighting techniques but are skilled at trapping, stealth, searching and perception. At level 15 rangers can pass through thick leaves unhindered and at 25 they are already very able swimmers as well.]]
}

tomeinfo.classes.rouge = {
  cc =
  [[Rouges live by cunning, yet capable of fighting dual-handed, making use of light weapons. As masters of traps and locks they detect those in a radius and can overcome almost any device. They are even able to use some complex devices and may train themselves to steal items from stores. At level 15 they learn how to cloak themselves, allowing them to pass by unseen by almost any creature. Their light weapons become very deadly when they execute surprising backstab attacks or aim at the vital points, dealing critical strikes.]]
}

tomeinfo.classes.adventurer = {
  cc =
  [[Adventurers are the most versatile of all classes. However, while they can train almost any skill and do not possess any specific strengths or weakness they also do not excel at anything in particular. They are hybrids, combining features of other more distinct classes in one character, creating unusual mixtures of abilities. They are difficult to play for beginners, because it can be hard to decide and find out what to do when faced with an overwhelming amount of skills.]]
