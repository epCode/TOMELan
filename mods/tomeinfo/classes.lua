  [[Warriors solve most problems by cutting them to
    pieces. They are good at fighting and bows/throws
    but bad at most other things, although they can
    train to use magic devices. They are able to dual-
    wield one-handers, which requires light armour.
    They can also choose the paths of an unbeliever,
    who disbelieves in magic so strongly, negating it,
    or the path of a martial artist, foregoing weapons
    for fighting bare-handed instead.
    In most cases warrior are seen using two-handers,
    or one-hander and shield, and heavy armour to go
    with either.]]
