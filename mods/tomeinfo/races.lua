tomeinfo.races = {}

tomeinfo.races.human = {
  cc = [[Humans are allrounders with no special weaknesses or strengths. They have no experience penalties and tend to go up in levels faster than most other races. They get a bonus on Climbing and Interception.]]
}

tomeinfo.races.half_elf = {
  cc = [[Half-Elves tend to be smarter and faster than humans, but not as strong. They are slightly better at searching, disarming, saving throws, stealth, and bows, but they are not as good at hand weapons. Half-elves are not effected by light naturally. They get a bonus on Bow-Mastery and on Interception.]]
}

tomeinfo.races.elf = {
  cc = [[Elves are not effected by light intrinsically and see invisible creatures. They are better at using mechanical devices than humans, but not as good at fighting. They tend to be wiser and smarter than humans or half-elves and good at searching, disarming, perception, stealth, and bows/ throwing. They get a bonus on Bow-Mastery, Stealth, Dodging, Calmness, Sneakiness.]]
}

tomeinfo.races.hobbit = {
  cc = [[Hobbits have infra-vision, resist black breath somewhat, have their dexterity sustained and get a dexterity bonus for not wearing shoes. They make excellent rogues (they prefer to be called burglars), but might want to train 'Health' skill to make up for having lower hit points than humans. Their strengths are bows/throwing, saving throw, searching, disarming, perception, stealth. They receive a bonus on Sling-Mastery, Sneakiness, Dodging, and especially Stealth.]]
}

tomeinfo.races.dwarf = {
  cc = [[Dwarves are headstrong miners and fighters of legend. Strong and wise, they are less intelligent than humans though but can never be blinded and learn to pass even the highest mountain regions at level 30. Since they live underground they have infra-vision, their toughness makes for a good saving throw and they are good with axes. They do have one big drawback, though. They are loudmouthed and proud, singing in loud voices, arguing with themselves for no good reason, and screaming out challenges to nearby foes. In other words, dwarves have miserable stealth.]]
}

tomeinfo.races.half_troll = {
  cc = [[Half Trolls have their strength sustained and are very strong but also stupid and always hungry. They are so ugly that goblins grimaces in their presence. Half-trolls are bad at searching, disarming, perception and stealth, get a penalty on Critical-Strike and large penalties on Archery, but receive a bonus on Health and Blunt-Mastery.]]
}

tomeinfo.races.dunadan = {
  cc = [[Dunadan are a hardy race of men from the west. This elder race surpasses human abilities in every field, especially constitution. However, being men of the world, very little is new to them and experience is harder for them to gain. Dunadain have their constitution sustained and receive boni on Combat, Archery and Interception skills.]]
}

tomeinfo.races.noldor_elf = {
  cc = [[Noldor Elves can see the invisible and resist light and the flow of time intrinsically. They are a race of immortal beings, dating far back to when Arda was young, masters of skills, strong and intelligent, although their wisdom is sometimes suspect. They do very well in all professions but there are few things they haven't seen yet and so experience is hard for them to gain. High-elves receive boni on Bow-Mastery, Stealth, Dodging, Nature magic, and a large bonus on Calmness.]]
}

tomeinfo.races.goblin = {
  cc = [[Goblins have a decidedly mixed reputation. They are almost always grinning, and more often than not you cannot tell whether or not they are eyeing you like a side of meat. They are as sturdy as dwarves and quite agile, making them good fighters and rogues. Being creatures of the night Goblins have natural resistance to darkness. They receive boni on Boomerang-Mastery, Stealing and Sneakiness.]]
}

tomeinfo.races.dark_elf = {
  cc = [[Dark Elves dwell below the surface in huge caverns of their underground city, in a very peculiar society. The children are already drilled to become sworn enemies of most other races of the underground and also of the hated elves who live on the surface under the bright sun. Overthrowing rivals by murder and treachery are acknowledged as long as no one is left alive to bring up charges. Dark Elves are not effected by dark, but light can damage them under certain circumstances. They receive a bonus on Stealth, Dodging, Sneakiness and Backstabbing.]]
